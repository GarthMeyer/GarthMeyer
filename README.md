As an End User Compute Engineer with expertise in managing desktop infrastructure, user access, and device security, I have developed a strong foundation in IT operations and support. I am now looking to transition into a Cloud Security Engineer role, leveraging my experience with endpoint security, identity management, and user access controls to protect cloud environments. My goal is to focus on securing cloud infrastructure, implementing best practices, and addressing emerging security threats in cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure.

## Objective


I aim to demonstrate my transition from end user compute engineering to cloud security by showcasing projects focused on securing Azure environments, identity management, and cloud infrastructure protection.
